# From Derivatives to Finite Differences

In this foundational assignment, students are introduced to the core concepts of numerical methods within the realm of high-performance computing. The focus is on mastering finite difference methods for approximating derivatives and applying these techniques in a practical programming environment using C/C++. Through this process, students will deepen their understanding of numerical data representations, particularly floating-point numbers, and gain hands-on experience in implementing and visualizing mathematical concepts.

Key learning outcomes include the ability to effectively represent and manipulate numerical data, the proficiency in applying and coding finite difference methods for derivative approximation, and the development of skills in using visualization tools like gnuplot for data analysis. This assignment serves as a bridge, connecting theoretical mathematical concepts with their practical computational applications, setting the stage for more advanced topics and challenges in the field of high-performance computing.
