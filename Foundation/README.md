# From Derivatives to Finite Differences

In this foundational assignment, students are introduced to the core concepts of numerical methods within the realm of high-performance computing. The focus is on mastering finite difference methods for approximating derivatives and applying these techniques in a practical programming environment using C/C++. Through this process, students will deepen their understanding of numerical data representations, particularly floating-point numbers, and gain hands-on experience in implementing and visualizing mathematical concepts.

Key learning outcomes include the ability to effectively represent and manipulate numerical data, the proficiency in applying and coding finite difference methods for derivative approximation, and the development of skills in using visualization tools like gnuplot for data analysis. This assignment serves as a bridge, connecting theoretical mathematical concepts with their practical computational applications, setting the stage for more advanced topics and challenges in the field of high-performance computing.

### Finite Difference Approximations vs. Exact Derivative of sin(x)

The provided PNG plot visualizes the comparison between finite difference approximations (forward, backward, and central) and the exact derivative of the function sin(x) at x=1. It illustrates how the approximations converge to the exact derivative as the step size (h) varies. The plot aims to depict the accuracy and stability of each finite difference method, offering a visual understanding of the impact of step size on the precision of numerical derivatives. This graphical representation serves as a crucial tool for analyzing the effectiveness of the numerical methods used in the assignment.
